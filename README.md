# AUTOMATIC-ROAD-SIGN-DETECTION-AND-VEHICLE-CONTROL-USING-NEURAL-NETWORKS-main


# Description:
The Road Sign Detection project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying and classifying road signs in real-time using image processing and machine learning techniques. This project is particularly useful for driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, enhancing safety by alerting or assisting drivers with traffic sign recognition.
The system uses a camera module (e.g., webcam or Raspberry Pi camera) to capture live video frames. These frames are processed using computer vision techniques like color segmentation, shape detection, and edge detection to locate potential signs. Detected signs are then classified using a trained machine learning or deep learning model (such as CNN) into categories like Stop, Speed Limit, Yield, No Entry, etc.
